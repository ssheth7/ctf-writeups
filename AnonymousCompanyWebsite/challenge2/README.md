## Challenge 2
#### The page gives you a "get tokens" button which gives 2 character strings and a text box for submitting the flag. In the url, there's a fields where "...quantity=2". So what happens if we change the number here? It changes the amount of tokens given. I then checked for basic encoding using burpsuite and found nothing significant. But upon closer look at the keys, there are similar characters at the same index of every string. I wrote a basic c++ program that would create a new string of those similar characters. First, I used two tokens, but the returned string did not work was the wron flag. However, there were instances where the first two strings had similar characters, but the third did not have that same character at the index. I then used 4 strings, and I got the flag.
